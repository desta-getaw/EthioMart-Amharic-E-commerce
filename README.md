## 🌍 Project Overview

This project addresses EthioMart's challenge of decentralised Telegram commerce in Ethiopia by:

1. **Centralizing Vendor Data**: Aggregating product listings from multiple Telegram channels
2. **Structured Entity Extraction**: Identifying key business information (products, prices, locations) from Amharic text
3. **Vendor Assessment**: Creating a data-driven scoring system for micro-loan eligibility

**Business Impact**: Enables EthioMart to offer capital to high-potential vendors based on actual business performance metrics.
